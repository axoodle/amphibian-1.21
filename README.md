silly minecraft mod thing

### planned features
- toggleable water breathing, with the option of also disabling air breathing
- since the vanilla bed can't be waterlogged, i'll either:
  - change it so that it can be waterlogged
  - make a special underwater bed
  - or just allow you to sleep on any surface underwater (this one seems the funniest)
